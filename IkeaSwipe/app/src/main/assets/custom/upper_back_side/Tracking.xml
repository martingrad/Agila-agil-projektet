						"hybrid" (default) : executes both edge and feature tracking continuously and supports each where possible; use for models that are reliably edge-trackable from all views
						"initialize_once"  : initializes only once with edge initialization, then continue with feature tracking; use for incomplete models, 2D models or other models not reliably trackable with edges
						"edge_only"        : Initialize and track only with edges only. Same behavior as EdgeBasedTrackingSensor. Use for model centered tracking with highly dynamic environment.

					<!-- Result configuration

						"feature" 			: prefer feature result when available, uses edge only for reinitialization; jitters less but may jump from time to time
